long_name,"A descriptive name that indicates a variable""s content. This name is not standardized.",O,"NUG, CF-1.8"
wmo__parameter_uri,Link to external code registry to unambiguously identify the parameter or variable reported. This may be one from the codes.wmo.int registry or from another registry specified in the profile definitions.,M,WMO-CF 1.0
wmo__parameter_name,Parameter name used to unambiguously identify the parameter or variable reported. Analogous to standard_name.,M,WMO-CF 1.0
