# Regulations defining dimension variables
- For gridded data with x, y, z and t as dimensions CF recommends order but this is not mandatory.
- WMO CF extends this by making ordering mandatory.
- Similarly, where other dimensions used (e.g. for discrete geometries) mandatory ordering specified by WMO CF
- This will be based on the profile / feature type
- Other dimensions shall appear to the left
- CF does not standardise dimensions names, WMO CF does. These are defined below
